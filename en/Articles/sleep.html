                <p>In the modern world, many people underestimate the importance of sleep. We sacrifice hours of rest for work, study or entertainment without realizing that this negatively affects our productivity, health and overall well-being.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
        To understand the importance and benefits of sleep, we need to become familiar with the phases of sleep and what they are. Sleep is divided into two main phases: rapid and slow sleep. Slow, in turn, consists of 3 stages.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
        • <strong>First stage</strong>: Light sleep, a transitional state between wakefulness and sleep.
                    <br/>
        • <strong>Second stage</strong>: Decrease in heart rate and body temperature.
                    <br/>
        • <strong>Third stage</strong>: Deep sleep, during which tissue and organ restoration occurs.
                    <br/>
        <strong>• <strong>REM sleep</strong>: The dreaming phase, which plays an important role in creativity, memory organization, information processing and emotions.</strong>
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
        <strong>Lack of sleep and lack of REM sleep</strong> can have a number of negative consequences for human health:
                    <br/>
        <strong>Cognitive impairment</strong>:
                    <br/>
        • Decreased concentration, memory and learning ability.
                    <br/>
        • Slower reaction and speed of information processing.
                    <br/>
        • Increased fatigue and sleepiness during the day.
                    <br/>
        • Decreased motivation and productivity.
                    <br/>
        <strong>Emotional problems</strong>:
                    <br/>
        • Increased irritability, anxiety and depression.
                    <br/>
        • Reduced stress resistance.
                    <br/>
        • Difficulty controlling emotions.
                    <br/>
        • Increased risk of developing mood disorders.
                    <br/>
        <strong>Physical problems</strong>:
                    <br/>
        • Weakened immunity.
                    <br/>
        • Increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease, diabetes and obesity.
                    <br/>
        • Acceleration of aging.
                    <br/>
        <strong>Therefore, if a person does not reach the fast phase</strong>:
                    <br/>
        • He does not get the opportunity to fully restore the strength and functions of the brain.
                    <br/>
        • It can lead to problems with memory, concentration, learning and emotional well-being.
                    <br/>
        • In the long term, it may increase the risk of developing dementia and other neurodegenerative diseases.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
        In order for a person to wake up in the desired phase of sleep and avoid sleep deprivation, a couple of important things should be done.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
        <strong>The need to monitor the inertia of your sleep</strong>.
                    <br/>
        Sleep inertia is the period after waking up when a person is not yet fully awake. It can last from a few minutes to an hour. Each person has his own individual inertia. Monitoring sleep inertia gives you a guarantee of always getting good and sound sleep.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
        <strong>To determine your sleep inertia</strong>, you need to conduct a small experiment. Try to sleep for 6, 7, 8, etc., hours, and after getting up, analyze your condition. If you wake up groggy, then you were unable to reach the REM phase of sleep, and if you got enough sleep, but feel lethargic, then you overslept. With these tests you can find your ideal sleep time.
                    <br/>
        Also pay attention to the following factors:
                    <br/>
        • How easy is it for you to get out of bed?
                    <br/>
        • Do you feel sleepy during the day?
                    <br/>
        • Can you think clearly and concentrate?
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
        <strong>How to get enough sleep effectively and quickly</strong>:
                    <br/>
        • <strong>Maintain a sleep schedule</strong>. Go to bed and wake up at the same time every day; on weekends, you can add a maximum of another 30 minutes of sleep.
                    <br/>
        • <strong>Create a comfortable sleeping environment</strong>. The room should be cool, dark and quiet; Before going to bed, it is advisable to turn on warm lighting so that the body produces melatonin for effective sleep (for the body, warm light is the same as an evening sunset).
                    <br/>
        • <strong>Avoid caffeine and alcohol before bed</strong>, as they can interfere with falling asleep and affect sleep quality.
                    <br/>
        • <strong>Exercise regularly</strong>, but not before bed.
                    <br/>
        • <strong>Relax before bed</strong>; try taking a bath, read a book, listen to calm music.
                    <br/>
        • <strong>Practice relaxation techniques</strong>: meditation, yoga, breathing exercises.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
        Healthy sleep is not a luxury, but a vital necessity. It provides us with physical and mental health, high performance, clarity of mind and the ability to be creative.
