                <p>Information flows from all sides, and work and study are often carried out on the computer, it is especially important to take care of productivity. One of the enemies of productivity is <strong>improper lighting</strong>.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
        <strong>Absolute darkness</strong>, at first glance, may seem ideal for concentration. However, studies have shown that the absence of light negatively affects human cognitive function. In the dark, reaction speed decreases, memory deteriorates, motivation decreases and the number of errors increases.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
        <strong>Light from gadgets</strong> is an even more insidious enemy. Blue light emitted from smartphones, tablets and computer screens suppresses the production of melatonin, a hormone responsible for sleep. This can cause a person to feel alert even if they are tired, making it difficult for them to fall asleep.
                    <br/>
        Lack of sleep, in turn, leads to drowsiness, lethargy, decreased concentration and performance.
                    <br/>

                    <br/>

                    <br/>

                    <br/>
